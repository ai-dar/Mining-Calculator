# Mining-Calculator

Mining-Calculator is a C# application designed to help users calculate the profitability of mining using various devices such as GPUs (graphics cards), CPUs (processors), and HDDs (hard drives). The application allows users to add devices to a virtual cart, calculates potential earnings and expenses, and provides detailed results on profitability over different time periods (per minute, day, month, and year).

The project was developed using **Visual Studio**.
